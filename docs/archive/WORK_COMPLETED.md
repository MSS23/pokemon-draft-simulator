# Pokemon Draft - Work Completed Summary

## Overview

I've successfully audited the codebase, updated the TODO list, and implemented critical security and production-readiness features.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Codebase Audit & Documentation

- **Audited entire codebase** to identify implemented vs pending features
- **Updated [TODO.md](pokemon-draft/TODO.md)** with accurate completion status
- **Created [DEPLOYMENT.md](pokemon-draft/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - comprehensive deployment guide

### 2. Security Enhancements (CRITICAL)

#### Database Security
- **Created [supabase-rls-policies.sql](pokemon-draft/supabase-rls-policies.sql)**
  - Replaced permissive "allow all" policies with proper Row Level Security
  - Implemented granular access control for all tables
  - Added policies for authenticated users only
  - Protected sensitive operations (host-only controls)

#### Authentication System
- **Implemented Supabase Auth integration**
  - Created `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` pages
  - Added OAuth support (Google, GitHub)
  - Implemented auth callback handler
  - Created protected `/dashboard` page
  - Fixed Suspense boundary issues for Next.js 15

### 3. Bug Fixes

#### Turn-Based Nomination Logic (High Priority)
- **Fixed auction draft nomination system** ([draft-service.ts:1114-1145](pokemon-draft/src/lib/draft-service.ts#L1114-L1145))
  - Implemented proper round-robin turn order
  - Added team validation
  - Prevents out-of-turn nominations
  - Provides clear error messages

### 4. Error Tracking & Monitoring

#### Sentry Integration
- **Installed and configured Sentry** for production error tracking
  - Created client, server, and edge configuration files
  - Integrated with error handler service
  - Added environment variable support
  - Updated Next.js config with Sentry webpack plugin
  - Only activates in production

#### Error Handler Updates
- **Enhanced error-handler.ts** to send critical errors to Sentry
  - Async error reporting (fire-and-forget)
  - Contextual error data
  - Development vs production handling

### 5. Build & Quality Assurance

- **Fixed TypeScript compilation errors**
  - Resolved async/await issue in error handler
  - Added Suspense boundaries for `useSearchParams`
  - Build now succeeds with only linting warnings
- **Verified production build** compiles successfully
  - All routes properly generated
  - Bundle sizes optimized
  - Static and dynamic routes configured correctly

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

### Immediate (Before Launch)

1. **Apply RLS Policies**
   ```sql

   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` to environment variables

3. **Configure Authentication**
   - Enable email auth in Supabase
   - Set up OAuth providers (optional)
   - Test auth flows

4. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required for production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn (optional)
   ```

### Short-Term Improvements

1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for critical services
   - Integration tests for draft flows
   - E2E tests with Playwright

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Responsive design refinements
   - Touch gesture support
   - Mobile-specific UI components

3. **Performance**
   - Code splitting
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Service worker for offline support

### Long-Term Enhancements

1. **Features**
   - Draft history tracking
   - Team export functionality
   - Custom format creator
   - Tournament management

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Pre-commit hooks (Husky)
   - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Storybook for components

- Authentication system created but needs Supabase configuration
- Sentry configured but requires DSN for activation
- RLS policies written but need to be applied in Supabase

## üöÄ How to Deploy

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](pokemon-draft/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# 1. Apply RLS policies in Supabase
# 2. Set environment variables
# 3. Build format packs
npm run build:formats

# 4. Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```
