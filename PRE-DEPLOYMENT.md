3. **Rollback steps**:
   - Revert to previous deployment in Vercel
   - Verify rollback was successful
   - Notify users if needed
4. **Post-mortem**: Document what went wrong and how to prevent it

---

## üìã Environment Variables Reference

### Required Variables

These environment variables are **required** for the application to function:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Where to find these values:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Project Settings" ‚Üí "API"
3. Copy "Project URL" for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
4. Copy "anon public" key for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Optional Variables

These variables are optional but recommended for production:

```env
# Error Monitoring (Optional - Sentry)
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id

# Analytics (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX  # Google Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID=your-vercel-analytics-id
```

### Development-Only Variables

These should only be used in development:

```env
# Development Database (Optional)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/pokemon_draft_dev

# Debug Flags (Development Only)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_DEVTOOLS=false
```

### Environment Variable Setup by Platform

#### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add each variable with appropriate scope (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Redeploy for changes to take effect

#### Netlify
1. Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Environment
2. Add each variable
3. Trigger a new deployment

#### Docker
Add to `.env` file in project root (DO NOT commit):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
```

### Security Best Practices

- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Store secrets in platform secret managers
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use different keys for production vs development
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Commit `.env.local` to version control
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Share keys in Slack/Discord/email
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Hardcode any keys in source code
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Use production keys in development

### Verification

To verify environment variables are loaded correctly:

```bash
# In development
npm run dev
# Check browser console - should not see "Supabase not configured" errors

# In production
# Navigate to your deployed site
# Open browser console ‚Üí Network tab
# Verify API calls are going to correct Supabase URL
```
