-- Migration: Guest-Compatible RLS Policies
-- Description: Secure RLS policies that support both authenticated users and guest access
-- This replaces the "allow all" policies with proper security while maintaining guest functionality

  -- For guest users, we'll rely on application-level checks
  -- The policies will be permissive for reads but strict for writes

-- ============================================================================
-- SECURITY NOTES
-- ============================================================================

-- This migration provides BASIC security while maintaining guest functionality.
-- For production, consider:
--
-- 1. Implement rate limiting at application or database level
-- 2. Add more granular validation in policies (e.g., check draft status)
-- 3. Consider using database triggers for additional validation
-- 4. Monitor and log suspicious activity
-- 5. Implement IP-based rate limiting for guest users
-- 6. Add honeypot fields to detect bots
-- 7. Consider migrating to full authentication over time
