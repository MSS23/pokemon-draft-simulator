### Step 3: Add to Vercel
```bash
cd "c:\Users\msidh\Documents\Projects\Pokemon Draft\pokemon-draft"

# Add Sentry DSN
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN production
# Paste your DSN when prompted

# Add Sentry org
vercel env add SENTRY_ORG production
# Enter your org slug

# Add project name
vercel env add SENTRY_PROJECT production
# Enter: pokemon-draft

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup (IMPORTANT)

### Verify RLS Policies Are Active

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "SQL Editor"
4. Run this query:

```sql
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Expected Output:
```
tablename       | policy_count
----------------|-------------
drafts          | 4
teams           | 4
participants    | 4
picks           | 3
auctions        | 4
bid_history     | 2
```

### If No Policies Found:

Run the RLS migration from your local file:
```bash
# The file is at:
# pokemon-draft/database/migrations/006_guest_compatible_rls.sql

# Copy the contents and paste into Supabase SQL Editor
# Then click "Run"
```
