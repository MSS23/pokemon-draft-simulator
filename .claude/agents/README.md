## How to Use Agents

### Method 1: Task Tool (Programmatic)
Use the Task tool in the Claude Code interface:
```typescript
// In your task
Task({
  agent: "format-validator",
  task: "Validate if Pokemon #1007 is legal in VGC Reg H"
})
```

### Method 2: @ Mentions (Conversational)
Mention agents in conversation:
```
@format-validator Is Tinkaton legal in the current format?
@type-fixer Help me resolve the TypeScript errors in draft-service.ts
```

### Method 3: Slash Commands
If integrated with slash commands, use:
```
/format-validator check Pokemon #1007
/draft-debugger fix turn order issue
```

## Agent Best Practices

### When to Use Agents
‚úÖ **Use agents when:**
- Task requires deep domain expertise
- Need systematic debugging approach
- Want consistent solutions following patterns
- Building comprehensive tests or documentation

‚ùå **Don't use agents for:**
- Simple file edits
- One-off questions
- Tasks spanning multiple domains (use general-purpose agent)

### Choosing the Right Agent
1. **Identify the domain** - Format rules? Database? Performance?
2. **Check agent expertise** - Read the agent's description
3. **Provide context** - Include file names, error messages, expected behavior
4. **Be specific** - Clear questions get better answers

### Agent Response Formats
Each agent follows a structured response format for consistency:
- **Issue/Query**: What you asked
- **Analysis**: What the agent found
- **Solution**: How to fix it
- **Code**: Implementation details
- **Testing**: How to verify
